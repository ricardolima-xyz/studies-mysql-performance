-- Adjusting the Buffer Pool Size

-- The default size of 128Mb is nice for setting up a test instance on your laptop without a 
-- draining of your memory. This is why the default value is so small. But, for production
-- systems, you most likely want to allocate more memory.

-- Verify Buffer Pool Size
SHOW GLOBAL variables like 'innodb_buffer_pool_size';
-- Set a global system variable 'innodb_buffer_pool_size' as 1 GB
SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1073741824;
-- Set a session system variable 'innodb_buffer_pool_size' as 1 GB
SET SESSION innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1073741824;
-- Persist a global system variable to the mysqld-auto.cnf file (and set the runtime value)
-- 'innodb_buffer_pool_size' as 1 GB
SET PERSIST innodb_buffer_pool_size = 1073741824;


-- Calculate the Buffer Pool Hit Rate
-- We should aim at having the buffer pool hit rate as close as 100% as possible

SELECT Variable_name, Variable_value
         FROM sys.metrics
        WHERE Variable_name IN
                ('Innodb_pages_read',
                 'Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests')\G
SELECT 100 - (100 * %Innodb_pages_read%/%Innodb_buffer_pool_read_requests%) AS HitRate;

-- Buffer pool instances
-- One way to reduce the contention, for parallel workloads, is to split the buffer pool into
-- multiple instances, with different mutexes for each instance.
